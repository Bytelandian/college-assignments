Instructions: 

   We are uploading 6 files contains test cases 1 to 6. The files are contained in the tar 
   archive "input-assgn5.tar.gz".
   
   For example, to run your program on test case 3, run the following command on your terminal:
  
   ./a.out <in3

   I am assuming that the name of your executable is "a.out".
 
   The "<" operator in Linux takes the input for a program from the filename specified after it,
   instead of taking input from the keyboard.

   IMPORTANT: 
              We will check your programs by giving your output to a ``checker", which will verify
              the output of your program. Therefore, you should EXACTLY follow the output format described below.

	      We are giving an executable ``checker" with this tar archive. It can be used to check whether the
              output of your program is correct. Run the ``checker" only when your program output "YES". For "NO"
	      output no need to use "checker". For example, to check your program on in5, first save the
              output to a file, say out5.
            
              Then, run the following command:

	      ./checker in5 out5

              Note that the input in5 and output out5 must be in the same directory as the checker.
              The checker will output "Correct" or "Incorrect" based on whether your algorithm gives the correct
              output or not. 

              Your program outputs will be checked in the above manner. Make sure you adhere to the output
              format described in the assignment handout. Also, the executable may not run on your computer, as it
              was compiled on my machine.
