# Linear Discriminants and Logistic Regression

### Problem Statement:
Implementing linear discriminants and logistic regression. For more details see [problem statement.pdf](Problem Statement.pdf) .

#### Results:
For result see [report](report.pdf) .

#### Q1

#### To execute the scripts :
1. Main File : hw2_q1.m
2. Other Lile : ma.m
3. Run the Main file `hw2_q1.m`.

#### Input :
There is no user input to the program . Program will automatically take the input data from the file .

#### Output :

	It will output 2 graphs .
		1st Graph consisting of three subplots:
			Color coded training data
			Likelihood
			Posterior probability
		2nd Graph consisting of three subplots:
			Color coded Training data
			Discriminant Function
			Class predicted for test data

#### Q3

#### To execute the scripts :
1. Main File : hw2_q3.m
2. Other Lile : featuretransform.m, lindiscriminant.m, objgradcompute.m, plotdecisionboundary.m
3. Run the Main file `hw2_q3.m`.

#### Input :
There is no user input to the program . Program will automatically take the input data from the file .

#### Output :

	It will output 2 graphs .
		1st Graph consisting of Dataset and Non linear decision Boundary:
		2nd Graph consisting of Dataset and Discriminant Function decision Boundary.
